# COBOL Static Program Analysis

`cobol-spa` reads a COBOL source file (or stdin), performs a static program analysis, and outputs the result in a file (or stdout).

The following types of static program analysis are supported:

* control flow graph
* dependency graph

The following output formats are supported:

* JSON (for further processing)
* DOT (graph description language)
* SQL (INSERT statements)
* PYTHON (builtin PrettyPrinter)

COBOL grammar is nasty. Therefore, `cobol-spa` parses only the most common applications of `PERFORM`, `SECTION` and `CALL` statements. However, the source code is pretty straightforward, so you can easily adapt it to your needs.

See [this demo](http://7ooo.mooo.com/zoom.php) for a control flow graph generated by cobol-spa.
